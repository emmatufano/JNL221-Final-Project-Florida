      <h1> Northerners are flocking to Florida, and here are the reasons why </h1>
      <p class="deck"> Florida, along with other southern states, saw the greatest increase in population from 2021 to 2022, while states like New York and California saw a loss of residents. </p>

          <p> What comes to mind when you think of Florida? Maybe you think of excellent beaches, palm trees, humidity, or alligators. Maybe you associate the state with paradise, a nice place to vacation, or maybe even a dream place to live. For many Americans, that dream is becoming a reality. </p>

          <p> The population of Florida is booming as movers from across the nation are looking to the sunshine state to be their new home. According to U.S. Census Bureau data, the population of Florida gained 655,221 residents from 2020 to 2022. In stark contrast, other big states, such as California and New York, lost almost 500,000 and 400,000 residents, respectively. 
</p>
          <p> The 1.019% increase in population change was the highest of any other state, with Idaho and South Carolina as close runner-ups. It is clear that Florida is experiencing an influx of residents. </p>

          <p>But why? </p>

          <p> There are three significant reasons: First, Florida is a more conservative state and was lax with their COVID-19 restrictions. This was a big factor for those from more liberal states with stricter restrictions. Second, Florida has no income tax, which is also another deciding factor for movers from high-income tax states. Last, it is almost always sunny and hot, a tempting trade-off for those coming from colder climates.  </p>

            <p> “People also did move because of COVID-19 to also live in an environment where they could work remotely, go to the beach, and in addition, go out because of the lack of restrictions,” Georgina Clamage, a realtor based in Sarasota County from Michael Saunders & Company, said in an interview. If you can live anywhere, why not pick somewhere less expensive and warmer? So, it seems, why not live in Florida?</p>

            <p>In an effort to open Florida’s economy, Governor Rob DeSantis, a conservative, lifted restrictions in September 2020, almost nine months before lockdowns were lifted in states such as New York and California. In these states, not everyone wanted to deal with masks and social distancing any longer than what they deemed necessary. This was another motivator for those looking to Florida. </p>

            <p> Georgina also points out that the real estate market in Florida really started booming in 2020, the year most affected by COVID-19. As more and more people move to the state, the real estate market will continue to be strong. These factors keep the economy of Florida alive and well, and growing.  </p>

            <p> The state has also never had a state income tax, unlike its Northern counterparts. While Florida has an income tax rate of 0%, California has the highest income tax rate in the United States, with a rate of 13.30%. Hawaii and New York follow, with rates of 11% and 10.90%, respectively. New Jersey rounds out some of the most expensive states with a rate of 10.75%.

              <p> The killer combination of high taxes, cold, and expensive housing has driven Northerners to the land of 80 degrees and affordability. “The 65 and up age group was the fastest growing demographic during that period. They are retirees who want to be able to play golf in the winter and want to be able to go to the beach, and just generally feel that the lifestyle here is more relaxing. Especially if they’re coming from a big city or a heavily populated state like New York or California, even Chicago,” says Georgina.  </p>

              <p> Despite the heavy influx of baby boomers, people of every age are moving to Florida. Georgina specifies that Florida, and specifically Sarasota County, is a great place to raise children. The county is equipped with top schools, famous beaches, and many outdoor recreation spots for kids. </p>

              <p> 
                 It can be said that Florida is a great place to move to, but how do Floridians who lived there well before the population boom feel? Their reaction: “Stop moving here!”</p>

              <p> Streets are filled with traffic almost every day. The usual ten-minute trip to the beach now takes 40 minutes, and there is barely any parking. Both tourists and Florida residents love going to the beach, but the state has failed to efficiently adapt to the population growth. </p>

              <p> “Infrastructure has always lagged behind in terms of keeping up with the number of people here,” Georgina says. “But they certainly seem to be trying different methods that possibly should’ve been done years ago in anticipation of the population growth.” </p>

              <p>Although the traffic is certainly an issue, Florida residents typically see what is known as the “slow season,” a decrease in tourists and traffic during the spring and summer months. This slowing alleviates the stress and annoyance that come with the crowded fall and winter seasons. </p>

              <p>These three reasons combined are the main motivators in prompting Northerners to move to Florida, and they will only continue to motivate more. </p>

              <P> 
                According to Georgina, people will only continue to move to the sunshine state. Predictions detail a population increase to 23 million people by July of 2023. </P>
